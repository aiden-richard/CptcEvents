# CPTC Events

The CPTC Events website will be an easy-to-use web app that allows people to find information about events happening at Clover Park. The core of the website will be the event calendar. The goal with the calendar is to be able to pack a lot of information into a cramped space like a calendar. We will do this by allowing the user to sort and filter the events that they see, as well as keeping the length of text to a minimum.

## Access
The website will be open to the public with limited read-only access. Once logged in with a verified account, members will be able to see events for groups that they are a part of. If the member is an admin of a group, they will be able to manage group members and post new events to that group.

A verified account is any user that can verify ownership of a cptc.edu email address. 


### Tech stack:
