# CPTC Events

## Overview
CPTC Events is an easy-to-use web app that allows people to find information about events happening at Clover Park. The core of the website will be the event calendar. The goal with the calendar is to be able to pack a lot of information into a cramped space like a calendar. We will do this by allowing the user to sort and filter the events that they see, as well as keeping the length of text to a minimum.

## Features

- Groups for keeping track of related events
